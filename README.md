# realneuralnetworks-notebook

These notebooks uses [RealNeuralNetworks.jl](https://github.com/seung-lab/RealNeuralNetworks.jl) to analysis [a zebrafish segmentation dataset](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.359620v2.abstract). The dataset is imaged using Electron Microsocpy. The neurons are automatically segmented and thousands of them are proofread by human. We performed skeletonization, morphological analysis, connectivity analysis, and combining morphology and connectivity for this dataset.
